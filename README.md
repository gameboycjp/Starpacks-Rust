# Starpacks
Creates modpacks for Starbound using symlinking and minimal file copying.

Works on both Windows and Linux.

Run as Admin on Windows! It will stop the program if it detects it's not user. Windows blocks off symlinks without it, it's a pretty stupid limitation.

If you know of any mods on the workshop that are folders, open an issue and link me the mod so I can test it with the wizard. Theoretically it should work fine with those without any fuss, though.

### TODOs

Bug fixes, UX improvements, and new features, like external mod symlinking, and perhaps workshop downloading for GOG.

I gotta make a GUI for this thing too.
